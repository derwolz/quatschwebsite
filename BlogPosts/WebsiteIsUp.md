# Welcome Quatsch!:
## What is Quatsch?
Quatsch is a German language learning party game in the vein of Apples to apples or Cards against humanity with several twists. First and most obvious is the introduction of the German language. There are rules on how and where certain cards can be played, but there is far more freedom in response, to the point that most of the responses become quatsch (nonsense). Secondly, there are fewer possibilities to judge on, but the judging player can throw curveballs to the other players by forcing them to use a specific word in their sentences. This is done through the judgement dice, a six sided die with different moods that the players will try to match their sentences to.

In summary, Quatsch is a party game about building nonsensical sentences in a foreign language.



## Road Map

### Where we are
We just completed a major Milestone in the completion of this project. The website works and looks decent. The game mechanics are planned out, the exact words of the judgement die may change or some vocabulary cards, but it is more or less ready.

Currently we are in the Market Research phase of product development. The game is finished outside of needing testers and artwork. Which you can sign up for <a href="">here</a> or by emailing <a href="mailto:info@quatschgame.com">info@quatschgame.com</a>. Once the Market Research is complete we can start marketing and getting people on board with the idea. Once we feel like there enough interest developed we will announce a crowdfund event on a service to be determined in the future.

## Tech Considerations
### AI Model used in sentence prediction

It's working, but there are going to be a couple oddities, occasionally it will interpret sie (they) as sie (her), trust your instincts on how to interpret the sentences that are created on the website.
